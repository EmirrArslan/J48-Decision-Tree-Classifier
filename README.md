# Effective Utilization of J48 Decision Tree Classifier in Data Mining using WEKA

## Abstract

In this study, we systematically evaluate the performance and effectiveness of models created using various data preprocessing steps and different parameter settings of the J48 classifier within the context of data mining. Our research contributes to a deeper understanding of the impact of different preprocessing methods and J48 algorithm parameters on classification performance. The insights gained from our study provide valuable guidance for optimizing decision-making processes and achieving more accurate classification outcomes in various data mining applications.

## Research Objective

The primary aim of this research study is to accurately classify the survivors of the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, or ticket types.

Our study showcases the importance of data preprocessing steps and parameter tuning in the effective utilization of the J48 decision tree classifier in data mining. By systematically evaluating different approaches, we have demonstrated how these choices impact classification performance.
